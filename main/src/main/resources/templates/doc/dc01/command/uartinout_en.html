<title>I2C and UART Communication</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h5>Description</h5>
	<p>For application development engineers, concepts like I2C can be
		difficult to understand. Simply put, when we write programs such as
		calling socket, the program helps us encapsulate the physical layer.
		However, in reality, the physical layer is about the exchange of
		electrical signals. For example, at any given moment, if one pin is
		high voltage, it represents '1', otherwise it represents '0'. Hardware
		achieves information interaction through these changes in high and low
		voltages.</p>
	<p>For instance, if we design our own communication logic using two
		wires, A and B, connecting them to corresponding pins on two chips,
		for information exchange, let's say we agree that wire B will change
		its voltage every 1ms. Wire A will then be used for data transmission.
		When the voltage on wire B changes (either from high to low or from
		low to high), the receiving chip measures the voltage on wire A. If it
		is high, it means data '1'; if it is low, it means data '0'. The
		sending chip only needs to control the rhythm within the specified 1ms
		interval to set the voltage on wire A to either high or low, thus
		transmitting data. This defines a simple hardware interface. In fact,
		the industry has defined many similar interfaces; some use 2 wires,
		others use 3 or more wires, but the actual principle remains largely
		the same. Generally, we don't need to know all the details of the
		protocol because the underlying driver already implements these level
		controls.</p>
	<p>UART is one of these protocols. Many devices use UART protocol
		for data transmission. Compared to SPI or I2C, UART is a peer-to-peer
		relationship between the two communicating ends. As mentioned above,
		with SPI or I2C, writing or reading data to or from sensors is
		initiated by ESP, meaning that unless ESP initiates it, the sensor
		will not actively send data. Therefore, ESP is the master, and the
		sensor is the slave. However, UART is a peer-to-peer protocol where
		both devices A and B can actively send data. Additionally, UART can
		only transmit point-to-point, meaning that two devices must be
		connected together; they cannot connect three or more devices.</p>
	<p>UART typically uses two lines for transmission, called TX
		(transmit) and RX (receive). Therefore, the pins of the two devices
		should be reversed, i.e., A device's TX connects to B device's RX, and
		A device's RX connects to B device's TX. If you just want to read or
		send, one line can also be used. Moreover, the GND (ground) lines of
		the two devices should be connected.</p>
	<h5>Receiving Data</h5>
	<p>Because the devices are in a peer-to-peer relationship, the
		other device may send data to this device's RX pin at any time. This
		device is always ready according to predefined configurations, and
		after receiving the data, it reports it to the cloud. The cloud stores
		and forwards the data accordingly. Therefore, there are two ways to
		obtain data: one is to query the latest received data via API, and
		another better way is to register a third-party system URL in advance
		so that the cloud can push the data to the specified URL upon receipt.</p>
	<p>
		To query, click <a href="/dc/web/doc?page=api&deviceType=dc01"
			target="_blank">here</a>. Through the API "Data Forward List", you
		can query the reported data.
	</p>
	<p>
		To push and forward, click <a href="/dc/web/apisetting"
			target="_blank">here</a> to configure your receiving URL. The UART
		message received will be forwarded to your URL via HTTP POST.
