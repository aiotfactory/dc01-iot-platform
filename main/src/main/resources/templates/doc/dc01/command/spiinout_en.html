<h5>Description</h5>
<p>For application development engineers, concepts like I2C can be difficult to understand. Simply put, when we write programs and call functions like socket, the program abstracts the physical layer for us. However, the physical layer always involves the exchange of electrical signals. For example, at a certain moment, if a pin is at a high voltage level, it represents a "1", otherwise, it represents a "0". Hardware uses these changes in high and low voltage levels to exchange information.</p>
<p>For instance, if we design our own communication protocol using two wires, labeled "a" and "b," each connected to corresponding pins on two chips, we can define a simple interaction logic. Suppose we agree that the voltage on wire "b" changes every 1ms. In this case, wire "a" is used for data transmission. When the voltage on "b" changes (e.g., from high to low or low to high), the receiving chip measures the voltage on wire "a". If it's high, it represents data "1"; if it's low, it represents data "0". The transmitting chip only needs to control the timing and adjust the voltage on wire "a" to high or low within the specified 1ms interval to transmit data. This is an example of a simple hardware interface definition. The industry has defined many similar interfaces, some using two wires, others using three or more, but the underlying principles are generally similar. Typically, we don't need to understand all the details of the protocol because the underlying driver already handles these voltage controls.</p>
<p>UART is one such protocol. Many devices use UART for communication. Compared to SPI or I2C, UART is a peer-to-peer protocol. As described above, in SPI or I2C, ESP acts as the master, initiating read/write operations with sensors, meaning the sensor does not send data unless ESP requests it. Thus, ESP is the "master" and the sensor is the "slave." However, in UART, both devices (A and B) are equal, and either A or B can initiate data transmission. Additionally, UART supports only point-to-point communication, meaning only two devices can be connected, not three or more.</p>
<p>UART typically uses two wires for communication, called TX (transmit) and RX (receive). Therefore, the pins of the two devices must be cross-connected: the TX of device A connects to the RX of device B, and the RX of device A connects to the TX of device B. If you only want to read or send data, connecting one wire is sufficient. Additionally, the GND (ground) of both devices must be connected.</p>
<p>What is RS485? Its principle and wiring are almost identical to UART, and the internal chip processing is also the same. The difference lies in the voltage levels of the pins. RS485 uses differential voltage, allowing for long-distance transmissionâ€”up to tens of meters without issues. In contrast, UART typically supports transmission distances of only a few dozen centimeters. In practical designs, the ESP itself provides UART capabilities, and the circuit board includes an additional RS485 chip to convert voltage levels. By default, the connection is not enabled and requires jumper caps J3, J10, and J12 to be installed. Once installed, it connects esp_gpio_1, 2, and 21 to the RS485 chip. Alternatively, instead of using jumper caps, other GPIO pins of the ESP can be connected via flying wires.</p>
<h5>Receiving Data</h5>
<p>Because the devices are peers, the other device may send data to the RX pin of this device at any time. This device remains on standby according to predefined configurations and reports received data to the cloud, where it is stored and forwarded. There are two ways to retrieve data: one is by querying the latest received data from the cloud via API, and the other (better) method is to pre-register a third-party system URL so that the cloud can push received data to the specified URL.</p>
<p>To query data, click <a href="/dc/web/doc?page=api&deviceType=dc01" target="_blank">here</a> and use the "Data Forward List" API to query the reported data.</p>
<p>To configure push forwarding, click <a href="/dc/web/apisetting" target="_blank">here</a> to set your receiving URL. Received RS485 messages will be forwarded to your URL via HTTP POST.</p>
