<h5>Description</h5>
<p>When the device is powered by a battery, it is necessary to monitor the battery level. If the battery is low, a reminder to charge or replace the battery should be triggered. A simple approach is to measure the battery voltage. For example, for a regular polymer lithium battery, charging is required when the voltage drops below 3.5V. Through experiments, a relationship table between voltage and remaining battery capacity can also be established.</p>
