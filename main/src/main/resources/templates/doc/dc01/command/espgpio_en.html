<h5>Description</h5>
<p>There are two types of GPIOs on the circuit board: one is the pin of the ESP32 chip, and the other comes from an expansion module. The reason for adding the expansion module is that the number of ESP32 pins is insufficient. However, the GPIOs of the ESP32 support more functions (refer to other documents for details). Currently, the extended GPIO only supports outputting high or low voltage levels. Fun fact: A pin is a soldering point on the chip, usually a thin metal wire-like structure. These pins are typically connected to terminals, posts, or sockets on the circuit board, making it convenient to connect external devices.</p>

<h5>GPIO Output</h5>
<p>To control a GPIO pin to output high or low voltage, you must first configure the pin mode via the GPIO page before controlling it.</p>
